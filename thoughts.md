1. Stay organized. Budget your time like it's money, since time is the scarce resource while you're at Turing School.

2. Communicate -- with your group, with instructors, with your support network. People can't help you if they don't know where you are at.

Strategies:

1. Using Pomodoro breaks even when I am working on projects during my free time

2. Doing some form of exercise daily, even if that is just a walk around the block.

Shoutout:

My mom has been encouraging me, and telling me stories of going back to school and doing well even in her 40s, which makes me feel like I will be successful at Turing.

I have lots of thoughts, like this one for example.
