1. Stay organized. Budget your time like it's money, since time is the scarce resource while you're at Turing School.

2. Communicate -- with your group, with instructors, with your support network. People can't help you if they don't know where you are at.

Strategies:

1. Using Pomodoro breaks even when I am working on projects during my free time

2. Doing some form of exercise daily, even if that is just a walk around the block.
